This is a simple script that pop ups a Google Map window with a banner at the bottom with whatever text you wish to display. The index.php is not necessary and is only included to demonstrate how the script works. Simply include googlePop.php and call the function popUp with the three parameters (latitude, longitude, string to display). That's it! Feel free to ask me any questions at the email above.
